## AWS Data Analytics - Specialty Certification Exam Prep
### 1. Introduction 
This is one of the speciality certifications of AWS, which means you have to acquire intermediate level of AWS before you go to the exam. 
Having hands-on experience of AWS definitely helps in a way which you are able to understand the architecture of the Analytics side of AWS, as well as the most cost-efficient way of using AWS tools.

### 2. Exam Cost 
This exam costs $300 USD and the certification expires in 3 years. If you previously registered for any other AWS cert exam, you can get 50% on this one. 

### 3. Exam Preparation  & Exam Day
The exam pass rate is 70% and overall I think it is not very hard. You can definitely rely on websites like AWS Learning and ExamTopics to get familiar with the question style. The exam is 180 minutes for 65 questions, and you will get the exam results right after you finish. 
On the exam day, I checked in 30min before the exam time, and I waited in the queue for almost an hour. I don't think it is normal because I took this exam in the Sat afternoon which is usually the most popular time (I think) for people who can only take exams during the weekends.
One reminder for those who is going to take this exam - you can turn your lamps / lights on before your exam starts if you start your exam later in the afternoon.
