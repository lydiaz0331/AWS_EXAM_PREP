## AWS Cerified Cloud Practitioner Exam Prep Guide
### 1. Introduction 
This certification is the most fundamantal and beginner level one among all AWS Certifications. This is a good choice for IT managers, consultants and senior level to understand basic but very important concepts of cloud services for their professional career needs. It took me about three weeks to prepare for the exam, excluding my normal work time. Generally speaking, this exam is not hard for me because I have some experience with AWS before. For beginners with little background with Cloud Computing, I recommend you spend two to three weeks (>= 3 hours per day) in order to be fully prepared for the exam. There are abundant free study materials online for CPP and I'll share those I've used and found helpful. 

### 2. Exam Cost 
This exam costs $100 USD and the certification expires in 3 years. However, I think it worths to take this certification not only because it is the easiest one but also AWS offers discount coupon after you take one of their certification exams. This 50% coupon can be applied to any other exam you take afterwards. For example, if you would like to take a Speciality exam which costs $300 USD, the coupon will actually save you $150, which is more than the cost of the CCP exam itself. 

### 3. Exam Day 
I took the online exam with Pearson and the overall experience was good. I did the system pre-check the night before I took the exam, and also an hour before the exam. I logged in my exam 30 minutes before the scheduled time, and a proctor will be there shortly to guide me through the room check and so on. The exam window is not that advanced for which you are not able to jump to any question no. you want. Nevertheless, when you reach to the last question, there will be a review window where you can revisit questions that you've flagged. The overall exam duration is 90 minutes, and you will know your result right after you finish. The exam pass score is 70%.

### 4. Resources 
- [AWS Official Study Guide and Sample Questions](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) This is the bible.
- [AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials (Second Edition)](https://www.aws.training/Details/Curriculum?id=27076) I didn't use this resource myself because I was not aware of it but I highly recommend this as it covers all you need to know in great detail
- [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUXZUAj_fCE) This is a great free tutorial video I used and I watched twice. I personally found it very useful explaining concepts such as network and distibution, security and etc.
- [Tom's AWS CPP Study Guide](https://tsunamicyber.io/aws-cpp/) This is a study guide created by people who already took the exam. He/She is nice enough to prepare 2 FREE practice exams (65 q of each) and terminology flashcards. I took those exams at least three times in order to memorize concepts. Try to hit an accuracy of 90% before you go to the real exam.
- [Another Free practice exam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXKE1SfityA&t=1029s) This is on YouTube but you can pause the video and press forward key to go through all 65 questions. 

This summerizes what I used to pass the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam. If you're interest in my 30 page study note, let me know! Thank you and good luck!
